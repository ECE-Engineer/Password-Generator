<+s>: I felt confident in my ability to use evrything I learned throughout this 
      module.I also feel that I'm becoming much more familiar with the 
      integration of the logical operators as well as all the loops I leanrned 
      in this Module. Also I believe I did a good job with the layout of this 
      program and I believe that I did a good job with my logical thinking 
      pertaining to this program.
      
      
<-s>: In this assignment the errors I ran into were caused when I was 
      initializing variables accidentally with the wrong char values. I had 
      accidentally set the UPPERCASE ASCII numbers to the lowercase assigned 
      variables and then visa-versa with the Uppercase assigned variables.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I will be careful to not assign the wrong values to the wrong 
variables. I will also continue to be concise with my comments in my programs 
as well as to improve the layout of the program and to improve my 
"good programming style". Also as I finish up this module, from time to time
I will continue to go back to review my programs to gain a better
understanding of loops, text files, logical operators, etc..
